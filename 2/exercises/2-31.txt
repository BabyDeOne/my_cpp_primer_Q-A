Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level
or low-level const applies in each case.

r1 = v2;
    Illegal; r1 is a reference. It can't be reassigned after initialization.
p1 = p2;
    Illegal; can't assign a constant object to a nonconst object.
p2= p1;
    Legal; but p2 can't be used to change the value of p1.
p1 = p3;
    Illegal; can't assign a constant object to a nonconst object. top-lvel const of p3 is ignored, but p3 has a low-level const.
p2 = p3;
    Legal; both p2 and p3 have a low-level const.
