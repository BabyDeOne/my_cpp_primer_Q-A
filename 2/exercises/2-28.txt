Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal. 
(a) int i , *const cp;
    i is an int object; cp is a constant pointer to an int. Illegal: cp is uninitialized.
(b) int *p1, *const p2;
    p1 is a pointer to an int, p2 is a constant pointer to an int. Illegal: p2 is uninitialized.
(c) const int ic, &r = ic;
    ic is an integer constant; r is a reference to an integer constant. Illegal: ic is uninitialized.
(d) const int *const p3;
    p3 is a constant pointer to an integer constant. Illegal: p3 is uninitialized.
(e) const int *p;
    p is a pointer to an integer constant. Legal.
