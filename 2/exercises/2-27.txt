Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;
    illegal, initializer of a reference must be a object
(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
    legal, p2 is a const pointer
(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;
    legal r is a reference to a constant, initialized with the constant 0.
(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
    legal, p2 is a const pointer to a const object
(e) const int *p1 = i2;
    legal, i2 is an int, p1 is a pointer to a constant int.
(f) const int &const r2;
    illegal, syntax error. 
(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;
    legal, r is a constant reference initialized with an int i, and i cannot be changed through r.
