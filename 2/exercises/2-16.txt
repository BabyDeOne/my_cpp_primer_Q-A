Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? if they are valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
(a) r2 = 3.14159  //valid, 3.14159 is assigned to d
(b) r2 = r1    //valid, i is indirectly assigned to d, type convert from int to double
(c) i = r2    //valid, d is directly assigned to i, value of d is truncated to an int
(d) r1 = d    //valid,value of d is indirectly assigned to i; value is truncated to an int.
