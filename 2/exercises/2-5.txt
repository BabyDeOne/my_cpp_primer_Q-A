Determin the type of each of the following literals. 
Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:

(a)
    'a': character literal, type is 'char'
    L'a': wide character, type is 'wchar_t'
    "a": character string literal
    L"a": wide character string literal
(b)
    10: integral literal, type is 'int'
    10u: unsigned integral literal, type is 'unsigned int'
    10L: integral literal, type is 'long int'
    10uL: unsigned integral literal, type is 'unsigned long int'
    012: octal integral literal, type is 'int'
    0xC: hexadecimal integral literal, type is 'int'
(c)
    3.14: floating-point literal, type is 'double'
    3.14f: floating-point literal, tyoe is 'float'
    3.14L: floating-point literal, type is 'long double'
(d)
    10: integral literal, type is 'int'
    10u: unsigned integral literal, type is 'unsigned int'
    10.: floating-point literal, tyoe is 'double'
    10e-2: floating-point literal, type is 'double'
