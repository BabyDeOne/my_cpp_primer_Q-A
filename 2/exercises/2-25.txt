Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.
(a) int* ip, i, &r = i;
    ip is a pointer and ip is uninitialized; i is an int and i is uninitialized; 
    r is a reference to i
(b) int i, *ip = 0;
    i is an int and i is uninitialized; ip is a pointer and ip is null or 0;
(c)int* ip, ip2;
    ip is a pointer and ip is uninitialized; ip2 is an int and ip2 is uninitialized;
