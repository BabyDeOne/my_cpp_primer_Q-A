Uing the variables in Exercise 2.28, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.
(a) i = ic;
    illegal; ic wasn't initialized.
(b) p1 = p3;
    illegal; p1 points to a plain int, but p3 has a low-level const
(c) p1 = &ic;
    illegal; p1 points to a plain int, but ic is const. we can convert a nonconst to const but not the other way around
(d) p3 = &ic;
    illegal; p3 is a const pointer, it can't be assigned or reassigned.
(e) p2 = p1;
    illegal; p2 is a const pointer, it can't be assigned or reassigned.
(f) ic = *p3;
    illegal; ic is a const int, it con't be assigned or reassigned.
